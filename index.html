        <h2>Welcome !</h2>
        My name is Rayane computer science graduate from <a href="https://www.esi.dz/">Higher School of computer science Algiers</a>.<br/>
        
        The goal of this website is to get you the essentials to get started with the field of computer 
        science.<br/>
        <ul>
        <li>In <a href="pages/00-algorithms-concepts/0-introduction.html">chapter 00</a>, we will explore fundamentals concepts used to
        find solution in computer science, often refferred to as <b>algorithms</b>.Our focus in this chapter will be on the importance of 
        the problem-solving mindset. We will discover that programming languages are actually tools to express and translate our thought 
        processes into instructions that a computer can understand!<br/>
        This chapter will cover the concepts: 
        <ol>
            <li>General overview of an algorithm.</li>
            <li><b>Sequential flow :</b> Understanding the basic execution of simple actions such as declaring variables and performing 
            read/write and other actions and operations.</li>
            <li><b>Control flow :</b> Exploring how decisions and branching (e.g., if statements) affect the execution path of a program.</li>
            <li><b>Loops :</b> Introduction to iteration and how to repeat actions efficiently using loops (e.g., for and while loops).</li>
            <li><b>Functions :</b> A way to modularize the thought process and reorganize the solution.</li>
            <li>Introduction to complex data structures :</b> structs and arrays.</li>
            
        </ol>
        </li>

        <li>In chapter 01, we will explore the essentials of computer architecture and how does a computer works. The 
        goal of this chapter is to give an insight of how is your computer understanding the program you are 
        feeding him.<br/></li>

        <li>In chapter 02, we will make our first step into data stuctures.</li>

        </ul>
