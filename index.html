        <h2>Welcome !</h2>
        My name is Rayane computer science graduate from <a href="https://www.esi.dz/">Higher School of computer science Algiers</a>.<br/>
        
        The goal of this website is to get you the essentials to get started with the field of computer 
        science.<br/>
        <ul>
        <li>In <a href="pages/00-algorithms-concepts/0-introduction.html">chapter 00</a>, we will discover concepts that are used to find solutions in the cs field in an abstract 
        manner you might have heard this as algorithms. In this chapter we will highlight the importance of the
        way of thinking, we will show that programming languages are only tools to express and to translate our
        way of thinking to the computer.</li>

        <li>In chapter 01, we will explore the essentials of computer architecture and how does a computer works. The 
        goal of this chapter is to give an insight of how is your computer understanding the program you are 
        feeding him.<br/></li>

        <li>In chapter 02, we will make our first step into data stuctures.</li>

        </ul>
